 Implementation Procedure
The implementation process provides detailed step-by-step instructions to clearly explain who (ISP or Implementation Engineer) will do each step and exactly how to complete the step.

This MOP will cover:

Add subnets into prefix-list
Verify route is now in route table
Verify routing is intact
Verify L3 connectivity via ping

#Verify interface is up/up

show interfaces GigabitEthernet0/7/1/19 detail | include GigabitEthernet0/7/1/19
!shows up/up, up/down, or down/down!

monitor interface GigabitEthernet0/7/1/19
!verify traffic(if any ,as this is a new interface turn up)!
#Verify route is now in route table

show route 172.28.91.200
!the subnet should be known via "local"!
#Verify routing is intact

show isis adjacency | include Total
!shows total adjacencies

show bgp summary
!shows BGP neighborships!

show pim summary
!shows PIM neighborships!
#Verify L3 connectivity via ping
